This course will dive into how you can get your best work done by identifying when and how to request a review, how to perform a review for someone else's pull request, and other awesome collaboration methods.

All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub—and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.

In this course, you’ll learn how to:

- Comment on pull requests
- Leave reviews on pull requests

- Request pull request reviews
- Accept changes introduced by a pull request review
