          Thanks for opening this pull request, @%user.username%.

          I've made a suggested change to this pull request because I think you should link your version of the game in your README file. I made this suggestion by creating a review comment that uses some :sparkle: special :sparkle: formatting.
          It looks like this:

              ```suggestion
              You can play the game [here]('%actions.pagesUrl.data.html_url%')
              ```
