# Congratulations! :tada:

Nice work helping me with all of these pull requests! As you embark on your journey of making GitHub better everyday, you might want to keep this article in your [back-pocket](https://githubber.com/article/crafts/engineering/how-to-review-a-pull-request#approving-a-pull-request) :jeans:. It covers a lot of the stuff we covered in this course and provides some more tips and requirements for reviewing pull requests within GitHub. If you have any questions along the way, make sure to ask you team (or the team you are helping) to answer any questions :question: as they come up.
