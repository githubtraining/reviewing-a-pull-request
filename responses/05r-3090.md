At GitHub we use a 30/90 rule when providing feedback. That means when a PR is 30% done, feedback should be focused on the feasibility of the project and if the architecture can handle the demands of the change. When a PR is closer to 90% done, it is time to bring out that fine-tooth comb and ensure that there aren't any typos, visual glitches, or rough edges that display a lack of polish to our users. 

We're optimizing for working together over the long term, so it helps to consider what the author needs right now versus what can be changed in a future branch.
