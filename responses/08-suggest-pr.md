Thanks for opening this pull request, @{{ user.username}}. 

I've made a suggested change to this pull request because I think you should link your version of the game in your README file. I made this suggestion by creating a review comment that uses some :sparkle: special :sparkle: formatting.

It looks like this:

```
```suggestion
You can play the game at: https://{{ user.username }}.github.io/github-games/
```
```
