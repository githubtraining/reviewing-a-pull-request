This is a pull request, unlike an issue where project contributors _discuss_ a bug or new feature, the pull request is where you can _share_ the changes being made to the repository. 

I've requested your review on this pull request, but don't be alarmed, I've just added your name to the `README.md` file, so you should be able to **approve** it with ease. 

Before reviewing this pull request, we should discuss how reviews work within GitHub. 

- Review requests are the most common way you will be request to review code
- After joining an engineering team, you should begin receiving _review requests_ from your team
- You might receive requests from other teams if the feature they are working on is inside your team's area of maintainership
- Our internal best practice is to acknowledge a review request within 1 business day by doing one of the following:
  - Leave a review
  - Leave a comment stating your intentions
  - Send the author a message in Slack
  - Reject the review request
