# Commenting on Pull Requests

As a collaborator on a repository, you will get and give pull request reviews before merging code. This is important! It ensures quality code and maintains momentum of changes to your project.

As you can see, I've opened this pull request and it would be great if you could review it. Issues are where project contributors _discuss_ a bug or new feature. Pull requests are places to _share_ the changes made to the repository.

### Responsibilities of a reviewer

As a pull request reviewer, your role is to help the pull request author by making sure:

- Code destined for production is of the highest quality
- Intentional shortcuts (technical debt) are commented on and confirmed
- The greater team is aware of potential risks associated with changes

These broad responsibilities can include more specific goals, like:

- Pointing out potential issues in code quality, security, or business logic
- Suggesting other reviewers to the author, when warranted
- Commenting on, approving, or requesting changes on the PR
- Providing suggestions for alternate or better implementation details

Some repositories use the [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/) feature as a part of the review process. When required, the code owner has the final authority to approve the pull request. Approving a pull request with `CODEOWNERS` may not be a formal approval, but it does show  _confidence_.

## Step 2: Communicate in pull requests

When an approval or request for changes is not yet needed, consider using **comments**. Comments enable you to inquire about the proposed change early in the review process. You don't need to wait until something is complete to make suggestions.
