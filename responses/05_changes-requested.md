## Requesting changes

Thanks for catching that bug. :bug: In my excitement to ship more stuff, I must have made a typo. I'm making a change to this branch to fix my mistake.

Not all of the pull request reviews you perform in the future will decide the color of the blocks in our Tetris game. :smile:

Although you may be tempted to leave shorthand comments like: :+1:, :poop:, `awesome!`, or `no`; these don't give the author of the PR much to run with. Providing comments like these enhance the conversation and enable the author of the PR to respond:

- This looks like it’ll be really helpful to our users, but I’m not entirely sure about the flow. I also have some concerns about the efficiency of these queries.
- Our [styleguide](https://styleguide.github.com/) prefers a different kind of spacing here.

While you were reading this, I made your suggested changes, so if you could approve my pull request, that would be awesome!
