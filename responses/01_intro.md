## Welcome!

Hello and welcome! In this course you will learn how you can get your best work done in pull requests.  You'll learn when and how to request a review, how to review someone else's code, and how to respond to reviews. To do this, we'll be playing around with the code in this repository that makes a simple Tetris game.

Assignees on issues and pull requests let other team members know who is responsible. The assignee oversees the issue or pull request in an accessible and visible way.

## Pull Requests Reviews 101
